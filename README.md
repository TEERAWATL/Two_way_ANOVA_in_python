# Two_way_ANOVA_in_python

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and sample code demonstrating the use of two-way ANOVA in Python. We use the `statsmodels` library to perform the analysis and visualize the results with the help of `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## Overview

Two-way ANOVA is a statistical method that allows you to study the impact of two categorical factors on a continuous dependent variable. This method helps to identify the main effects of each factor and the interaction effect between the two factors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- statsmodels
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Tips to Use Two ways ANOVA 

we used two-way ANOVA because it allows us to analyze the effects of two independent categorical factors on a continuous dependent variable simultaneously. Two-way ANOVA helps to study not only the main effects of each factor but also the interaction effect between the two factors. By considering the interaction, we can identify whether the effect of one factor depends on the level of the other factor.

One-way ANOVA, on the other hand, is used when you have only one independent categorical factor affecting the continuous dependent variable. One-way ANOVA helps determine if there is a significant difference in the means of the dependent variable across different levels of the single factor.

We used two-way ANOVA in the previous examples because we wanted to analyze the effects of two factors and their interaction on the dependent variable. If you only have one factor to consider or if you're not interested in studying the interaction between two factors, then you could use one-way ANOVA instead.
